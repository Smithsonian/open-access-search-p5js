p5js Open Access Search

Using P5js, this application provides a way to search through a small subset of the Smithsonian Institution collections marked as Open Access. Open Access items carry whatâ€™s called a CC0 designation. This means the Smithsonian dedicates the digital asset into the public domain, meaning it is free of copyright restrictions and you can use it for any purpose, free of charge, without further permission from the Smithsonian. To search through more Smithsonian Collections, beyond the Open Access records, please visit the SI.edu Collections Search page.

A prerequsite to using this application to search through the Open Access records is to obtain an API key from the Data.gov.
